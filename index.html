      <h2>As a child, you see all sorts of things that you don't understand. One of these is
        banks. These sneaky little death traps are really shady and attention should be payed towards them.
        However, you have reached that age (in this case, 16) where you need to keep a place
        for the money that you don't spend on toys and lollies.<br>
        The above cards show 4 different types of banks, each with their own names and interest rates.<br>
        As you start to grow up, you notice that not everything is the best it can be. Banks are a
        perfect example. Every bank has different interest rates and lots of sneaky little traps that could
        make you worse off. That's why you should try and think about the choices you're about to make.<br>
        As a 16-year-old, you get <span>weekly payments</span> of <span>$361.16</span>. You want to put this in a bank to save for your first car.
        The car you're looking at buying is going to cost <span>$24,000</span>, which isn't a lot of money for a car.
        Now, because you're still with your parents, all the money from those payments are going in the bank <span>every week</span>.
        Not only that, you already have $6,000 saved up.<br>
        The balance of your account, in dollars, after <em>n</em> weeks, V<sub>n</sub>, can be modelled by the recurrence relation
        shown below.<br>
        V<sub>0</sub> = 6000,     V<sub>n+1</sub> = rV<sub>n</sub> + 361.16<br>
        Use your knowledge of Further Mathematics terminology to answer the
        following questions in order to "grow up".<br>

          <p>Last week, you had your 25<sup>th</sup> birthday. To many, this is an important milestone, however, you are still
            living with your parents, which is a really bad thing at your age. Due to the haggling of your mates, you decided, on your better
            judgement, to buy a house.<br> The house you're looking at getting is right in the heart of Melbourne,
            a thriving metropolis in the south of Bogan Land (a.k.a Australia). However, this house is very expensive, with the
            price set at $560,000. To help soften the blow to your budget, the bank is offering a loan of $540,000, leaving you $20,000 out of pocket.
            Lucky your account is ripe with money. You've taken the offer and leaving high and dry in your 2-bedroom home.<br>
            Now, hang on! You still have to pay the bank! The bank had offered you two types of loans: an <em>interest only loan</em>, and a <em>compounding loan</em>, that compounds <em>monthly</em>. You are to answer the following questions to figure
            out what loan is the best for your needs. Should you choose the compounding loan, you arranged to have the loan fully paid off in 24 years. The loan has an interest rate of
            <span>4.7% per annum, compounding monthly</span>. You are willing to put forward <span>$12,000</span> to begin with and will pay <span>$3060.12</span> at the end of the month (which leaves $67.64 a month for food, water and clothes: poor planning, I know).

        slowly lost its value. With every chipped bumper and "I think I'm going to hit that cat" tyre screech that we all know, the humble Jazz
